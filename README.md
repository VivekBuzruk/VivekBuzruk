# Why "Day in a Developer's Life Series" and this Github project
- Empower Aspiring Professionals & Strengthen their end-2-end Software Application Development Skills.
- Software Development is not just coding but starts with understanding/ analyzing Problem statement, Architect / Design the solution and then develop quality Software Application.

> End goal should not be just partial problem solving but end-2-end Software Application Development. Application can be a Batch/ Colnsole application, Desktop application, Web / Mobile Application or even Microservices.

# Importance of Programming Languages and detailed learning
> Do not just search for the solution and fix the problem. Your programming skills need to be continuously improved. Apart from learning new technologies / concepts, continuously improve programming skills.

We started YouTube channel [Programming Languages and S/W Development](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfSRL7P22zbKk_fgIyRN-Y_hx66lZqn4E) with this intention of making every developer a great Software Engineer too.

### Each directory within this project has a README.md which provides a link to respective YouTube lecture.
